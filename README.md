# Reverse Integer Script

This repository contains a Python script to reverse the digits of an integer without converting it into a string. The solution is implemented efficiently using arithmetic operations.

---

## Features

- Handles positive and negative integers.
- Avoids string manipulation for performance optimization.
- Handles edge cases such as:
  - Zero (`0`)
  - Numbers ending in zeros (e.g., `1200 → 21`).
  - Single-digit numbers.

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x is required to run this script.
- No additional libraries are needed.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reverse-integer-script.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd reverse-integer-script
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python reverse_integer.py
   ```

---

## Code Example

Here’s a quick look at the function you’ll use:

```python
def reverse_integer(number):
    """
    Reverses the digits of an integer without using string conversion.
    Args:
    number (int): The number to reverse. Can be positive or negative.
    Returns:
    int: The reversed number.
    """
    is_negative = number < 0
    number = abs(number)
    reversed_number = 0
    
    while number > 0:
        last_digit = number % 10
        reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + last_digit
        number //= 10
    
    if is_negative:
        reversed_number = -reversed_number
    
    return reversed_number
```

### Example Usage
```python
print(reverse_integer(1234))  # Output: 4321
print(reverse_integer(-567))  # Output: -765
print(reverse_integer(1200))  # Output: 21
print(reverse_integer(0))     # Output: 0
```

## Testing
To test the script, you can create a Python script or directly use the function in an interactive Python shell. Example tests are included in the `reverse_integer.py` file (commented out).
